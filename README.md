This is my first project following The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com).

The assignment is to create a webpage that looks like the Google search homepage (www.google.com) using only HTML and CSS.

HTML elements that have been used include: div, nav, footer, form, input

CSS used includes: classes, flexbox, :hover, box-shadow, :first-child,:last-child

Inspecting elements on the official page with DevTools was used to aid with colour matching and font-size.
